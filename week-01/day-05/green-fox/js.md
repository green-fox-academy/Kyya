## Test input

```javascript

const mentor = new Mentor();
people.push(mentor);

const elon = new Sponsor('Elon Musk', 46, 'male', 'SpaceX');
people.push(elon);

const sponsor = new Sponsor();
people.push(sponsor);

student.skipDays(3);

for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
  elon.hire();
}

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  sponsor.hire();
}

people.forEach((person) => {
  person.introduce();
  person.getGoal();
})

const awesome = new Cohort('AWESOME');
awesome.addStudent(student);
awesome.addStudent(john);
awesome.addMentor(mentor);
awesome.addMentor(gandhi);
awesome.info();
