# Counter

 -  Create a `Counter` class
     -  which has an integer property
     -  when creating it should have a default value 0 or we can specify it when creating
     -  we can `add(number)` to increase the counter's value by a whole number
     -  or we can `add()` without parameters just increasing the counter's value by one
     -  and we can `get()` the current value as string
     -  also we can `reset()` the value to the initial value
