# Animal

 -  Create an `Animal` class
     -  Every animal has a `hunger` and a `thirst` value
     -  When creating a new animal object, these values are created with the default `50` value
     -  Every animal can `eat()` which decreases their hunger by one
     -  Every animal can `drink()` which decreases their thirst by one
     -  Every animal can `play()` which increases both by one
