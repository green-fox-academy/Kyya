# Sharpie

 -  Create `Sharpie` class
     -  We should know each sharpie's `color`, `width` and `inkAmount`
     -  When creating one, we need to specify the `color` and the `width`
     -  Every sharpie is created with a default 100 as `inkAmount`
     -  We can `use()` the sharpie objects
     -  which decreases inkAmount
