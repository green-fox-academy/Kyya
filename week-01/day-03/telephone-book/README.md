# Telephone book

We are going to represent our contacts in a map where the keys are going to be
strings and the values are going to be strings as well.

- Create a map with the following key-value pairs.

  | Name (key)          | Phone number (value) |
  | :------------------ | :------------------- |
  | William A. Lathan   | 405-709-1865         |
  | John K. Miller      | 402-247-8568         |
  | Hortensia E. Foster | 606-481-6467         |
  | Amanda D. Newland   | 319-243-5613         |
  | Brooke P. Askew     | 307-687-2982         |

- Create an application which solves the following problems.
  - What is John K. Miller's phone number?
  - Whose phone number is 307-687-2982?
  - Do we know Chris E. Myers' phone number?
