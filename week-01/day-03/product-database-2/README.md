# Product database 2

We are going to represent our products in a map where the keys are strings
representing the product's name and the values are numbers representing the
product's price.

- Create a map with the following key-value pairs.

  | Product name (key) | Price (value) |
  | :----------------- | :------------ |
  | Eggs               | 200           |
  | Milk               | 200           |
  | Fish               | 400           |
  | Apples             | 150           |
  | Bread              | 50            |
  | Chicken            | 550           |

- Create an application which solves the following problems.
  - Which products cost less than 201? (just the name)
  - Which products cost more than 150? (name + price)
