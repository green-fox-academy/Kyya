# Map introduction 1

We are going to play with maps. Feel free to use the built-in methods where
possible.

- Create an empty map where the keys are integers and the values are characters
- Print out whether the map is empty or not
- Add the following key-value pairs to the map

  | Key | Value |
  | :-- | :---- |
  | 97  | a     |
  | 98  | b     |
  | 99  | c     |
  | 65  | A     |
  | 66  | B     |
  | 67  | C     |

- Print all the keys
- Print all the values
- Add value D with the key 68
- Print how many key-value pairs are in the map
- Print the value that is associated with key 99
- Remove the key-value pair where with key 97
- Print whether there is an associated value with key 100 or not
- Remove all the key-value pairs
