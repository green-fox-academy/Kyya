Get movie titles, using the given API:
https://swapi.co/

 -  Create a very simple layout of two lists besides each other: see [wireframe](../assets/swapi.png).
     -  it should have a label
     -  an input field (text)
     -  and a button
 -  The input text's content should be sent to the people's api and you should perform a search with it.
 -  If you get the response, you should display all the results. 
 -  If the user clicks on the character's name, then perform another Ajax request and display all the films they appeared in.
 -  In the second list, display the movie like this: Movie title (release date).
 -  Explore the documentation and find requited API endpoints by yourself.
