# Click Three Times

Create a simple HTML document with one button. \
If the user clicks the button 3 times, and 5 seconds is already elapsed since
the page is loaded, a text should appear under the button: \
`5 seconds elapsed and clicked 3 times` \
If the user starts clicking before the first 5 seconds, nothing should be
printed
