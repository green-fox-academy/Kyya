  <!-- 
    In JavaScript you can define your own custom events. Try it!
    In the main.js you can see that if the left-side-click event is dispatched on the div then it will change its background-color.
    Also if the right-side-click is dispatched the background will change again.

    Define these two events.
     - If the div's left side (0-200px) is clicked then dipatch the proper event 
     - If the div's right side (200px-400px) is clicked then dipatch the proper event 
     - Work in the provided main.js file.
